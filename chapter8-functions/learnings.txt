- A function is group of statement performing a specific task
- When a program gets bigger in size and its complexity grows, it gets difficult for a program to keep
track of which piece of code is doing what.
- The programmer needs to be extremely careful while working with recursion to ensure that the function
doesn't infinitely keep calling itself. recursion is sometimes the most direct way to code and algorithm.
