- Walrus Operator:

The walrus operator(:=) introduced in Python 3.8, allows you to assign values
to variables as part of an expression. This operator, named for its resemblance
of the eyes and tusks of the walrus, is officially called the 
"assignment expression".

-Types in Python:
Type hints are added using the colon(:) syntax for variables.

- '__name__' evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is ran.
- If the module is been run directly from the command line, the '__name__' is set to the string "__main__".
Thus, this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file.

- The 'global' keyword is used to modify the variable outside of the current scope.
- The 'enumerate' function adds counter to an iterable and returns it.
- List comprehensions is an elegant way to create lists based on existing lists.
