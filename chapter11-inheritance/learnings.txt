Inheritance in Python is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a 
class (called the child class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) 
from another class (called the parent class or superclass).

Inheritance is a way of creating a new class from an existing class.


üîç Why Use Inheritance?
- Code Reusability: Avoid writing the same code multiple times.

- Extensibility: Build on existing code by extending or modifying behavior.

- Organization: Create a clear hierarchy between general and specific classes.

üß± Basic Syntax:

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent!")

class Child(Parent):
    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello from Child!")

# Usage
c = Child()
c.greet()       # Inherited from Parent
c.say_hello()   # Defined in Child


üîÅ Types of Inheritance in Python:
Single Inheritance: One child inherits from one parent.

Multiple Inheritance: One child inherits from multiple parents.

Multilevel Inheritance: A class inherits from a child class of another class.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from the same parent.

Hybrid Inheritance: Combination of any of the above types.

üîß Overriding Methods:
A child class can override a method from the parent class:

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):  # Overrides parent method
        print("Hello from Child")

c = Child()
c.greet()  # Output: Hello from Child

üõ† Using super():
The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class.

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        super().greet()
        print("Hello from Child")

c = Child()
c.greet()
# Output:
# Hello from Parent
# Hello from Child

- A class() method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class;
@classmethod decorator is used to create a class method.

methods:
-str()
- __len()__
- __add()__
