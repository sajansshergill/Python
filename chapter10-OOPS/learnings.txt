Great question!

ðŸ§  **OOPs = Object-Oriented Programming System**

Itâ€™s a way of structuring your Python programs by bundling **data** and **functions** into reusable blocks 
called **objects**.

ðŸ§± Core Concepts of OOPs in Python

| Concept        | What It Means                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class**      | A blueprint for creating objects (like a template).          |
| **Object**     | An actual instance of a class (with real values).            |
| **Attributes** | Variables associated with an object.                         |
| **Methods**    | Functions that belong to a class and operate on its objects. |

 ðŸ§° 4 Key OOP Principles (P.I.E.A.)

| Principle            | Explanation                                                          | Example                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Polymorphism**  | Same function name can behave differently for different classes      | `+` works for both numbers and strings             |
| **2. Inheritance**   | A class can **inherit** properties and behavior from another class   | `class Dog(Animal):`                               |
| **3. Encapsulation** | Restrict access to data using **private/protected** variables        | `_name` or `__name`                                |
| **4. Abstraction**   | Hiding complexity; only show necessary features (like using `len()`) | We donâ€™t need to know how `len()` works internally |

ðŸ§ª Simple Example

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Create object
my_dog = Dog("Bruno")
my_dog.speak()
```

Output:

```
Bruno says woof!
```

âœ… Why Use OOPs?

* **Cleaner code** (modular, reusable)
* **Real-world modeling** (e.g., Bank, Train, Employee)
* **Better debugging and maintenance**
* Ideal for **larger projects** or teams
