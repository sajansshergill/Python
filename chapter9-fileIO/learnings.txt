- The random access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program terminates in order to 
persist the data forever, we use files.

f = open("file.txt")
print(f.read())
f.close()

# The same can be written using with statement like this:
with open("file.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())

# You dont have to explicitly close the file
